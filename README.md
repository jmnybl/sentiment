# sentiment
Simple Finnish sentiment data created by JLKK2016 students during demonstrations and exercise work.

### files
positive.txt = list of positive words

negative.txt = list of negative words

data.tsv = tab separated file of sentences and annotated sentiments, sentences are sampled from Suomi24 (http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2017021503) discussion chains mentioning Greece somewhere in the chain (the sentence itself does not have to mention Greece)
